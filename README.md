# sgRNA-cleavage-activity-prediction

## What is this?
This python script collection is used to predict the activity scores of sgRNAs (CRISPR/Cas9). This program is especially useful for biologists and bioengineerers interested in using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in bacteria, because the sgRNA activity dataset used to train this model is experimentally determined in model bacteria *E. coli*, which is the first such dataset obtained in bacterial host to the best of our knowledge. The paper comprehensively describing this algorithm and relevant experiments is currently under review, we are going to post it once its publication. Please cite the paper if this program is useful to your work.
